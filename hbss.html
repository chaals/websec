		<h2><span class="secno">1. </span><dfn id="sec-introduction">Introduction</dfn></h2>
		<p>
		The open web platform is running on diverse devices, such as tablet, PC, smart phone, and cars systems. Driven by an expectation from users and service providers, a majority of those devices are embedding some technology allowing to offer some secure services. One can think about secure chips such as embedded secure element, TPM, UICC, or proximity smart card, using BLE or NFC communication means. Another technology getting traction is the Trusted Execution environment. Both types of technology are offering some advantages in terms of secure execution and storage. Secure element and TEE can offer some services, which are names secure services, as their merits in term of integrity and confidentiality are improved. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This document is proposing some use cases where the web apps could benefit from secure services. In addition, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of such secure services, the Hardware Based Secure Services Community Group has identified two services, for which technical rationale and API will be detailed. In addition some protoypes, testing the reliablility of the architecture, will be developed. The elected secure services are (1) secure transaction confirmation and (2) secure credential storage.
		</p>

		<h3><span class="secno">1.1 </span>Terminology</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Secure Service: any service that should manage sensitive operations and that would benefit of/depends upon the 
			use of an hardware based security solution.</li>
			<li>Relying party: the Web application providing the Secure Service and requesting the hardware access</li>
			<li>Issuing authority: well known in X509 certificates scheme as certificate authority, the issuing authority is in charge of issuing a associated key/identity pair to a known identity and to maintain its lifecycle. The end-user identification is out-of-scope of this document but is clearly mandatory to associate a key to a genuine identity.</li>
			<li>Origin: in reference to the Single Origin Policy, an origin is referred in this document to an HTTP URL with scheme, host, port without path</li>
			<li>Secure Element: A secure element is a tamper proof device, providing a secure storage and execution environment for sensitive data and processing. It offers both physical and logical protection against attacks, ensuring integrity and confidentiality of its content.</li>
			<li>User Verification Method: This is the way the Secure Element authorize keys usage only to the genuine user. Could be what you know like a PIN code or what you are through a biometric face/finger/iris... end-user authentication</li>
			<li>Identity: to be verified by the issuing authority, the identity is cryptographically linked to the key demonstrating who has confirmed a transaction or signed a document</li>
			<li>Key: asymmetric cryptographic public/private key pair, sometimes linked to an identity</li>
			<li>Trusted User Interface: User interface component outside the direct browser scope providing 
			an additional level of trust in regards to the transaction confirmation message presented to the end-user to acquire its acknowledgment</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><span class="secno">2. </span><dfn id="sec-problem">Problem Statement</dfn></h2>

		<p>At this time Secure Element are not yet usable by web applications. For years, various form factors have been usable thanks to many native API and technologies (PKCS#11, Microsoft API like CSP / Minidriver, Java applet ...). Use cases are valid for native applications but browsers have not been working on integrating those technologies. The need to use secure services in all types of application (native, web app, hybrid) is becoming important, especially on the mobile devices. This document is targeting to define the next generation Javascript API for hardware based keys management and usage, including two specific features :the secure transaction confirmation and the secure credential storage. Those two technologies were identified, because they are key to the corresponding underlying components requirements to re-enable a strong security and identity ecosystem.</p>
		
		<p>The management of keys is associated with the problem of key usage. On the open web platform, the security principle that prevails everywhere is the Single Origin Policy. This strict policy may have some limitation in some specific cases, where several parties are involved in the delivery of a secure service.</p>
		
		<p>Single Origin Policy: one main matter of interest of the hardware-based secure services community group members is how to protect key usage considering the special use case where the credentials are used outside their issuing origin. As an example: Let's consider that a domain foo.com issues a key. Because the keys won't be accessible with a Javascript API from any domain, we have to design a secure system where the domain bar.com is allowed to use this key.</p>

		
		<p>This first version of the report will not address this issue but will focus on:
		<ul>
			<li>pre-existing X509 certificates accessible under the full control of the end-user to any transaction confirmation request.</li>
			<li>any API issued key MUST only be managed and used by its origin</li>
		</ul>
		Further extension will be added to authorize various origins to use and manage a particular key.</p>
		
		<p><em>Position to FIDO and WebAuth standards:</em> this document is focusing on providing web developers means to
		issue and use identity keys (whether they are X509 certificates or any other cryptographic model with underlying
		asymmetric cryptography).
		FIDO standards is related to device authentication: in the FIDO vision, it is up to the relying party 
		to manage the link between the credential and the identity.</p>
		
		<p><em>Position to WebCryptoAPI standards:</em> this report includes to WebCryptoAPI so that
		web developers can rely upon the same API but with a different initialization (like Java Cryptographic Engine with hardware provider).</p>
		
		<p>The user verification method is out of scope of this specification. But it should be clear whether a key is protected by
		<ul>
			<li>the user presence confirmation (presence)</li>
			<li>the underlying OS user verification method like an handle to the registered fingerprint template (os)</li>
			<li>a specific and private key bound with user verification method like a specific PIN or a specific fingerprint/iris template (active)</p></li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		The Relying Party should take care that:
		<ul>
			<li>with the passive option, there won't be any effective user confirmation - it's only about device authentication</li>
			<li>with the presence option there is no assurance that the right user is really behind the user-agent</li>
			<li>with the os option, there is options provided by the OS manufacturer to manage real world use cases - i.e. sensor not capturing the fingerprint switching to the PIN code</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h2><span class="secno">3. </span><dfn id="sec-usecases">Use cases</dfn></h2>
		<p>
			The hardware based technology is already used in a number of use cases, which are particularly sensitive to security attacks. Those domains cover financial and telecommunication industry, government and corporate services. Hardware based technology is used in those domains in specific cases such as managing authentication of the user or of the device, capturing user consent, document signature... The following use cases are detailing how hardware based technology are used today in different areas, in native environment. One should read those use cases as attractive for in web application scenario.
		</p>
		
		<h3><span class="secno">3.1 </span>National electronic identity for accessing public services. </h3>
		<p>
		As of today, a large number of european countries have deployed electronic identity, and do offer their citizen the access to to governement services such as paying tax, managing pensions. Eaxmples of countries and associated systems are : Estonia with eEstonia, Belgium eID with eService ecosystem, Sweden with a Tax Agency card and Telia eID, Norway with its ID-porten. All the deployed solutions are relying on middleware deployment on citizen devices. </p>
		<p>
		Whatever is the service accessed, it is expected by the citizen that he or she owns a hardware based token, that will carry its electronic identity. This identity (most of the time a certificate for a key pair) will be used to authenticate the user and sign some transaction he or she will be performing on the government portal. The native environment, installed on the citizen device, or on the public service office is able to access to the hardware token, thanks to a physical link (USB, ISO, BLE, ...).
		</p>
		<h3><span class="secno">3.2 </span>Financial transaction signature, with user consent</h3>		
		<p>The remote access to financial account, together with the electronic fund transfer are now part of citizen habits in developed countries. Most of the banks do offer in their account package this remote management service. In some conditions, usually defined by the bank, some extra security are requested to the consumer to finalize transactions. This extra security aims at improving the usual login/password security barrier. Depending on the use case, it could be either a one time password sent by SMS, or a user operation to confirm his or her presence, or a real signature of the transaction itself. That last step requires the user to use some credentials, distributed by the bank, usually stored in a secure container, such as a hardware based token (USB token or proximity token). In that case, the signature will be made on a serie of data, including the amount and the destination and source of the transaction, plus some additional information, as desired by the bank.</p>
		<h4><span class="secno">3.2.1 </span>French ecosystem</h4>
		<p>
			In France, a trusted issuing certificate authorities list is maintained by the Finances Ministry in order to manage corporate identities 
			Certificate authorities used to manage the face to face identity verification and deliver smartcards or USB tokens.
			This ecosystem is also used by the French corporate banks to manage
			many regulatory related tasks and also to enforce strong authentication but also digital signature, for example to confirm the file containing the widthdrawal of the salary for a company. 
			And issuing authentication credential is not acceptable according to the
			existing risks they are facing in terms cyber attacks: combined social engineering, phishing, stolen TAN...
			Banks are looking to cover the transaction risk by using the right credential to adapt the user experience to the risk, which includes also the strongest level for the highest risk. And now without the capability to rely upon Secure Elements in the browser, they currently facing a major issue to replace the existing identity scheme delegation which was providing a strong authentication and signature credential.

		<h3><span class="secno">3.3 </span>Transparent device authentication for online payment confirmation on 3DSecure scheme</h3>
		<p>To be completed by Brian (Visa Europe)</p>

		<h3><span class="secno">3.5 </span>The expectation from secure services</h3>
		<p>
		Whatever is the envisaged use case, signing a tax payment, confirming a transaction payment, validating the signature of a document, the service needs to rely on a genuine signature and user control. Each service provider needs to have a certain flexibility in designing its security model. Nevertheless, there are some minimum common basic functions that one can find in most of the security operations. The Hardware Based secure Services Community Group identified two technical features that are used on a regular basis : the secure transaction confirmation, and the secure credential storage. It is expected that those secure services, when being implemented natively in user agents, will offer a certain level of resistance and a certain level of trustworthiness. In the following section, those features will be detailed in the form of APIs and their security merits.
		</p>
		
		<h2><span class="secno">4. </span><dfn id="sec-api">Secure transaction and secure credential storage APIs</dfn></h2>

		<p>This section contains the API descriptions and the different rationale for the architecture and design choices. It covers both functionalities related to the storage and usage of credentials in a hardware based token, and the secure transaction confirmation. Those feature do rely on the presence of a credential, lets call it a key. </p>
		<p>The life cycle of this key is usual : creation, usage and deletion. In the framework of this short life community group, we will take the following assumptions on the key lifecycle :
		<ul>
			<li>the key has already been generated</li>
			<li>the service using the key is an authorized service - in the framework of the SOP, it is the same service that created the key. The Community Group is in parralel also working on the definition of a mechanisms to allow an entity to use some keys generated by another entity, but this requires the definition of a new type of data, associated with a specific key, and this is for future deliverable. Note : all use cases are envisaged with a pre-existing key set.</li>
		</ul></p>
		<h3><span class="secno">4.1 </span>Secure transaction interface</h3>
			
		<p>NOTE: This subpart of the API is relying upon pre-existing keys.</p>

		<h4><span class="secno">4.1.2 </span>Secure transaction API details</h4>

		<p>The secure transaction confirmation aims to give the assurance to a remote entity that a transaction is confirmed by the user. Its value relies in the fact that the requested confirmation was sent to the user, was displayed to the user with no alteration and that the user confirmed exactly what was displayed. This is the 'What You See Is What You Confirm' principle.
		<ul>
			<li>Transaction confirmation: This operation is defined to request from the browser and underlying security capabilities to ensure that the transaction context, also called non-repudiation message, has been presented to the end-user and provide non-repudiation</li>
			<li>Device authentication: This operation should be used when the relying party is trying to use a hardware key to authenticate the device without any user consent</li>
			<li>Digital signature: This operation is defined to allow binary data signature.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4><span class="secno">4.1.6 </span>Security considerations</h4>
		<p>This 4.1 section covers the various usages of keys. The use cases (transaction confirmation, signature, device authentication) are not highly sensitive in terms 
		of transaction confidentiality, which means that standard SOP rules are considered sufficient without any need for end-to-end encryption (like secure messaging). <br/>
		To avoid context swapping, it is mandatory that the non-repudiation message contains specific data for the requested
		transaction with the requesting party, the purpose of the transaction and the date of the operation.</p>

		<p>Assumption: for many different reasons, complex data are not the right
		format to get the end-user consent and confirm her/his acknowledgment: 
		<ul>
			<li>Liability: The major reasons is that this type of API is targeting valuable transactions with liability. 
			And for most regulations, liability relies upon the end-user capability to understand the message and confirm it.
			So only the simplest format should be considered: no color, no emphasis, no image.
			</li>
			<li>Technical: structured documents (XHTML, XML, RDF, PDF ...) cannot be presented in trusted UI</li>
			<li>Accessibility: no image should be used</li>
		</ul>
		So it should be:
		<ul>
			<li>text only</li>
			<li>not too short: it should give enough context information to protect against social engineering and replay attacks</li>
			<li>not too long: it should be displayable on almost every end-user terminal and read by the end-user</li>
			<li>scoped: it should target a particular operation (type, amount, beneficiary ...) at a particular time</li>
			<li>localized (UTF-8)</li>
		</ul>
		What it should not be:
		<ul>
			<li>full list of terms and conditions - but it can be the operation to confirm that the end-user agree with a particular version of the terms and conditions</li>
			<li>a generic operation request because it would not be scoped (i.e: "Do you confirm this signature operation ?" or "Do you want to confirm the authentication ?")</li>
		</ul>
		
		NOTE: a particular attention should be paid to UTF-8 characters support with the wide variety of similar characters.
		Therefore, both	the context and the data should be signed at the same time with the same key. It is then up to the relying 
		party to ensure	that the data associated with the context are both signed and they match the initial request
		The user has accepted the context (and liability may rely only on that context in regards to this cryptographic operation) 
		The data signature (i.e. PDF signature) is then a way to embed into the data the user consent.</p>
		by producing with its own cryptographic key the binary data signature. 
		<p>SECURITY NOTE: it could occur that the binary data are altered before signature by a malware or javascript or any software attacking the user agent. in such scenario, the altered binary data would be successfully signed on the user agent side. It is up to the relying party to check that the binary data and the context received are signed with the same key. In addition, the relying party, as part of its security policy, will be able to reject any attempt to submit binary signed data if they are not provided with a valid signed context.
		</p>
		<p>Within this signature operation, the mode for the user verification method MUST NOT be neither <code>"passive"</code> nor <code>"presence"</code>.</p>


		
		<h3><span class="secno">4.2 </span>Secure Credential Storage</h3>
		
		<p>This subpart describes a JavaScript API for discovering named, origin-specific pre-provisioned cryptographic keys stored into hardware secure device to be used with the Web Cryptography API. Pre-provisioned keys are keys which have been made available to the UA by means other than the generation, derivation, importation and unwrapping functions of the Web Cryptography API. Origin-specific keys are keys that are available only to a specified origin. Named keys are identified by a name assumed to be known to the origin in question and provisioned with the key itself.</p>
		
		<h4><span class="secno">4.2.1 </span>Secure Credential Storage API</h4>
		
		<p>This API relies on the existing but enhanced WebCrypto API to support key naming, as proposed in WebCrypto Key Discovery note, but also defines the notion of HardwareSecureDevice which represents any form of hardware cryptographic device acting as cryptographic provider, in a similar way of what JAVA defines, to bring new capabilities to the SubtleCrypto interface and in particular the persistent and secure storage of keys.</p>
		
		<h5><span class="secno">4.2.1.1 </span>Window interface</h5>
		
		<p>Window interface is enhanced to expose a the hardware secure device management service.</p>

		<h5><span class="secno">4.2.1.2 </span>HardwareSecureDeviceManager interface</h5>
		
		<p>The HardwareSecureDeviceManager interface provides access to hardware secure devices and is the source of events notifying their presences. The notion of presence is important because an hardware secure device MAY not always be stucked in the same environment (like an embedded secure element, a TEE...) but MAY be shared with severals (like with a Smartcard, an NFC card...).</p>

};
					</code>
				</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>The attribute hardwaresecuredevices represents the list of hardware secure devices presents and acccessible by UA at the time the attribute is accessed. UA is in charge to add or remove element in that array depending of the evolution of the environment in term of presence and absence of hardware secure device. User MAY define two event listeners (onHardwareSecureDevicePresent and onHardwareSecureDeviceRemoval) which will be called by UA to notify the user of the ongoing changes of the environment in term of presence or absence of hardware secure element.</p>

		<h5><span class="secno">4.2.1.3 </span>HardwareSecureDevice interface</span></h5>
		
		<p>The HardwareSecureDevice interface extends the SubtleCrypto interface providing a different implementation of one or more SubtleCrypto methods in order to let the hardware device handle the cryptographic operation internaly instead of the UA in software. It can be viewed as a cryptographic provider bringing cryptographic capabilities of an hardware device to the WebCrypto API in a transparrent maner. UA MAY defines other classes extending the HardwareSecureDevice one representing different type of hardware secure device with specific implementation. One implementation COULD be using PKCS#11 as transport layer to communicate with a compatible hardware securedevices</p>

		<p>The attribute name is used to identify in a human readable way the hardware secure device.

This attribute will typically be checked by UA before trying to perform any cryptographic operation on the hardware secure device.</p>

The CryptoKey interface and in particular the method getKeyByName is improved to add an optional parameter of hardwaresecuredevice type. If this parameter is provided, the look up for a key with the given name MUST occur only in the targeted hardware secure device. Prior to that, UA MUST validate the presence of the targeted hardware secure device first and then UA MUST call the same method than the callee one but on the provided hardware secure device object. The remaining executive flow remains unchanged as defined in WebCrypto API. In case of absence UA MUST throw an exception by using the reject promise. If the optional parameter is not provided, the search MUST occur only in software wherever the keys are usually stored by UA.</p>

		<h4><span class="secno">4.2.2 </span>Permission</span></h4>

		<h2><span class="secno">5. </span><dfn id="sec-architecture">Architectures and security requirements</dfn></h2>
		
		<p>These requirements are provided to split the responsibilities of each vendor / software providers for the different implementation environments </p>

		<h3><span class="secno">5.1 </span>Attestations</h3>
		<p>
			Both the Secure Credential Storage and the TrustedUI should be securely identified 
			by attestation. These attestations should be implemented as exposed in the the <a href="#FIDO20_ATTESTATIONS">FIDO 2.0 Attestations</a>.
		</p>

		<h3><span class="secno">5.2 </span>PC-like environments</h3>

		<p>It is typically the environment where secure elements - either smartcards with readers or usb tokens - are used 
		with middleware through PKCS#11 or Microsoft Minidriver. In this architecture, the trusted UI is:
		<ul>
			<li>Either the middleware when the signature is requested through PKCS#11 library</li>
			<li>Or the Microsoft Windows operating system which manage the secure element user interface for CSP/CNG API</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In this implementation, it means that the origin of the request and the non repudiation message
		should be displayed by the middleware or the Windows OS in a trusted way. </p>
		
		<p>To limit the capability of a website to request the usage of the cryptographic API,
		browser implementers SHOULD support a mechanism of white / black lists of 
		authorized domains (like camera access), so that an end-user could reject 
		any request from an unknown origin.
		</p>
		<p>
		NOTE: transaction confirmation could be supported by providing the merge of the origin and the
		non repudiation message as the data to sign for existing API. It MUST be displayed to the end-user with the user verification method input.
		But signature operation will require a interface definition new method for both PKCS#11 and CSP/CNG
		</p>

		<h3><span class="secno">5.3 </span>Mobile environments</h3>

		<p>In mobile environments, Secure Elements are either:
		<ul>
			<li>device binded like embedded Secure Element</li>
			<li>roaming like SIM or external NFC/BLE factors</li>
		</ul>
		But there is no capability to add middleware. It is up the OS manufacturer to provide support for the
		Secure Elements and provide an API for third party applications including browsers. 
		</p>
		
		<h4><span class="secno">5.3.1 </span>Generic mobile environments</h4>
		<p>
		In this situation, the trusted user interface should be part of the Operating System, interacting with
		the Secure Credential Storage
		</p>

		<h4><span class="secno">5.3.2 </span>Mobile environments with Trusted Execution Environment</h4>
		<p>
		In this situation, the browser is a trusted app and the trusted UI is relying upon the existing
		TEE functions (See [GP_TEE])
		</p>
		
		<h3><span class="secno">5.4 </span>About implementations considerations</h3>
		
		<p>Implementation into a mobile phone will require:
		<ul>
			<li>browser modifications to interact with TEE</li>
			<li>a trusted application interacting with the Secure Element</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

        <h3><span class="secno">6. </span><dfn id="sec-todo">TODO</dfn></h3>
        <p>The following topics need to be managed later:
			<ul>
				<li>Attestation retrieval by the issuing authority to evaluate the environment (TrustedUI & SE)</li>
				<li>Post issuance of the key: a specific operation should be added to the Secure Credential Storage API for two reasons: filtering the certified public keys to match the one accepted by the service provider and adding the certified public key during transaction confirmation, device authentication or signature</li>
			</ul>
